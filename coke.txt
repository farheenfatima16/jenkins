On May 8, 1886, Dr. John Pemberton served the world’s first Coca-Cola at Jacobs' Pharmacy in Atlanta, Ga. From that one iconic drink, we’ve evolved into a total beverage company. 

More than 1.9 billion servings of our drinks are enjoyed in more than 200 countries each day. And it’s the 700,000 individuals employed by The Coca-Cola Company and 225+ bottling partners that help to deliver refreshment across the globe.
